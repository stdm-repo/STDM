## simulation-code
This folder contains the code required to reproduce the complete simulation results presented in **Section 5** and **Appendix B.1** of the paper. As the full simulations involve multiple competing methods, various settings, and 200 replications per setting, the code for **Section 5.2** utilizes parallel computing to reduce runtime. We would recommend to reproduce the full simulation results with a computing system of at least 16 cores and 500GB of storage. The following list provides the guidance for each file in the folder.
1. Under ```Part 1``` folder, the R code will generate results for part of Section 5.2 and Appendix B.1  
   - ```Figure 1 & Table 1 & Table B1.R``` will plot Figure 1 and generate the tables for Table 1 and Table B1. It will also generate intermediate temporary data which is stored under the folder ```Results/Simulation-code/Part 1```.

2. Under ```Part 2``` folder, the R code will generate results for part of Section 5.2  
   - ```Table 2.R``` will generate Table 2. It will also generate intermediate temporary data which is stored under the folder ```Results/Simulation-code/Part 2```.

3. Under ```Part 3``` folder, the R code will generate results for part of Section 5.3 and Appendix B.1  
   - ```Table 3 & Figure 2 & Figure 3 & Table B2.R``` will plot Figure 2 and Figure 3, and generate the tables for Table 3 and Table B2. It will also generate intermediate temporary data which is stored under the folder ```Results/Simulation-code/Part 3```.

## real-data-code
This folder contains the dataset and the codes to reproduce the real data analysis results presented in Section 6 and Appendix B.2 in the paper.

1. Under ```data``` folder, it contains the original dataset and the generated dataset for the real data analysis.  
   - ```taxi_zones``` folder contains the necessary location information. The dataset is publicly available at [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Please download the data file "Taxi Zone Shapefile (PARQUET)".  
   - ```combined_data.csv``` is created by ```data_combine.R```. It combines all the original data files into a single dataset. The dataset is publicly available at [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). Please download the "Yellow Taxi Trip Records" data files for all months from 2011 to 2019. We do not include the raw data here due to its large size.  
   - ```location.csv``` is created by ```location_generate.py```. It contains location IDs, longitude, and latitude extracted from ```taxi_zones```.  
   - ```mahh.csv``` contains location IDs and their corresponding labels: 'uptown', 'midtown', or 'downtown'.

2. ```data_combine.R``` generates the basic dataset ```combined_data.csv```. The subsequent codes use this data to generate results.

3. ```location_generate.py``` generates location information. The subsequent codes use these labels for plotting.

4. ```p_q_compare.R``` generates Table 4 and Table B3.

5. ```real_data.R``` plots Figure 4. It also generates intermediate temporary data stored under the folder ```Results/real-data-code```.

6. ```manhattan_plot.py``` plots Figure 5a using data from ```mahh.csv```.

7. ```plot_figure5bc.py``` plots Figure 5b and Figure 5c using data generated by ```real_data.R```.

8. ```plot_figure6.py``` plots Figure 6 using data generated by ```real_data.R```.

9. ```appendix_real_data.R``` generates intermediate data for Figure B1, which is stored under the folder ```Results/real-data-code```.

10. ```plot_figure5bc.py``` plots Figure 5b and Figure 5c using data generated by ```real_data.R```.

11. ```plot_appendix.py``` plots Figure B1 using data generated by ```appendix_real_data.R```.
